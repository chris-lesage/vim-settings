This is a repository of my Vim settings.

I'm currently (2016-04-26) switching to Neovim, and I also use Vim and Gvim and Macvim, so this configuration needs some better IF statements to handle different environments.

The setup I am using is to put the config file in ~/.vim/vimrc
Then in ~/.vimrc I have two lines:

" the settings are found under ~/.vim/vimrc
runtime vimrc

As of this writing, I am not tracking or syncing any of my plugins.
